# Contribution Guide

This will explain the steps for proposing new solutions and reporting typos or other issues.

## üí° Proposing a solution

To propose a solution to an existing problem, please fork the repo and create a PR using the [Solution Template](https://github.com/shin10kudev/weekend-code-challenge/blob/master/SOLUTION_TEMPLATE.md)

Insert your solution at the end of the `SOLUTION.md` file in a section titled `## Other soluions`. Please create this heading if it doesn't already exist.

### üìù Tips

- Check your spelling and grammar
- For consistency, try to match function and input names from other solutions in the same problem (e.g. if an argument is called `numbers`, use `numbers` in your function as well)

## üêõ Fixing issues or typos

All programmers are great bug catchers -- and copy editors, too! If you notice something you'd like to fix, please fork the repo and submit a PR using the provided [PR Template](https://github.com/shin10kudev/weekend-code-challenge/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

As an alternative, you can submit an issue using an [Issue Template](https://github.com/shin10kudev/weekend-code-challenge/issues/new/chooose).

## ‚úÖ Note on submissions

Weekend Code Challenge is a curated list of problems and solutions with the goal of teaching useful techniques and problem solving skills to the larger programming community.

Although I'll try my best to use what you submit as is, I reserve the right to modify the text for spelling and grammatical fixes, which may include such things as changing the description, title and/or code in any way to better highlight key points or make the syntax and voice consistent with the other solutions presented on Weekend Code Challenge, and to change or remove submissions at any time without notice.

Please see the [License](https://github.com/shin10kudev/weekend-code-challenge/blob/master/.github/LICENSE.md) for Weekend Code Challenge for more information.
